Ant Design is easy to use and it is extremely suitable to be used to make dashboard kinda layouts. However, the thing that I was amazed the most is Redux Toolkit. This is my first time using it, and it has saved up much efforts on the initial setup of Redux (I might be wrong, it has been long since I last used Redux).

Saw this resource online, and thought it would be cool to build along to explore new things including new React UI Design library and new way of making request to API. Besides, it is good to know Rapid API, such an amazing platform that provides some free tiers APIs across different industries.
